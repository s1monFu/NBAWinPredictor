# NBAWinPredictor
The motivation for the analysis is to figure out what variables give an NBA team a greater chance of winning a basketball game. Our report will be covering NBA games from the 2003-2004 season all the way through the 2019-2020 season. Since last season was odd with an abnormal amount of games and zero fans plus the current season (2021-2022) is still ongoing, we will not be including their games in the data. Even though coaches and players vary each season, we will only be looking at the game statistics in this report. The questions of interest examine whether the location of a game, such as home or away, influences the chance of a team to win, and whether the conference that a team belongs to is more likely to win. It also compares different game statistics to help us predict their relationships to a winning team. In order for an NBA team to win a game, it is more favorable for a team to belong in the Western conference, while having higher 3-point and field goal percentages.
